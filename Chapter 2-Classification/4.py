# Train/test split
# To objectively assess a Machine Learning model you need to be able to test it on an independent set of data. You can't use the same data that you used to train the model: of course the model will perform (relatively) well on those data!

# You will split the data into two components:

# training data (used to train the model) and
# testing data (used to test the model).
# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Randomly split the flights data into two sets with 80:20 proportions. For repeatability set a random number seed of 17 for the split.
# Check that the testing data has roughly 80% of the records from the original data.

# Split into training and testing sets in a 80:20 ratio
flights_train, flights_test = flights.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=17)

# Check that training set has around 80% of records
training_ratio = flights_train.count() / flights.count()
print(training_ratio)
