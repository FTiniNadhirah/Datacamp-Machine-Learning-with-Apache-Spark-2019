##Removing columns and rows
##You previously loaded airline flight data from a CSV file. You're going to develop a model which will predict whether or not a given flight will be delayed.
##
##In this exercise you need to trim those data down by:
##
##removing an uninformative column and
##removing rows which do not have information about whether or not a flight was delayed.
##Note:: You might find it useful to revise the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.

##Remove the flight column.
##Find out how many records have missing values in the delay column.
##Remove records with missing values in the delay column.
##Remove records with missing values in any column and get the number of remaining rows.
# Remove the 'flight' column
flights = flights.drop('flight')

# Number of records with missing 'delay' values
flights.filter('delay IS NULL').count()

# Remove records with missing 'delay' values
flights = flights.filter('delay IS NOT NULL')

# Remove records with missing values in any column and get the number of remaining rows
flights = flights.dropna()
print(flights.count())
